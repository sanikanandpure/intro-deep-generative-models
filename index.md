# Introduction to Deep Generative Models
This is a reading group under the Directed Reading Program (DiRP) at UT Austin. This group will cover concepts starting from basic computer vision concepts such as filtering, convolutions, edge/object detection, etc. and will slowly build up to more complex models including CNNs, RNNs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs, VAE-GANs, VQ-VAEs), GANs, and Diffusion Models. This website is intended to be a central hub for notes, papers, and many other resources that will be helpful to anyone researching this topic. 

### Credits:
Many of the images and content for these notes were taken from the following courses:
- [Deep Learning for Computer Vision by NPTEL-NOC IITM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqSpQzTE6M_PI-rIz4O1jEgffhJU9GgG)
- [UT Austin CS 378: Generative Visual Computing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/CS378_Generative_Visual_Computing.html)
- [Stanford CS 231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
- [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

I try to give due credit under slides and images I copy/paste whenever possible. If there are any sources I am missing, please reach out!
