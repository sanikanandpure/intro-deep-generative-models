# Introduction to Deep Generative Models
This is a reading group under the Directed Reading Program (DiRP) at UT Austin. This group will cover concepts starting from basic computer vision concepts such as filtering, convolutions, edge/object detection, etc. and will slowly build up to more complex models including CNNs, RNNs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs, VAE-GANs, VQ-VAEs), GANs, and Diffusion Models. This website is intended to be a central hub for notes, papers, and many other resources that will be helpful to anyone researching this topic.
